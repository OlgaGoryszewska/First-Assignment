    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">[To secure your website I will recommend not trusting any data from the browsers at first. Next secure accounts with a strong password. There are also ways to double secure your entry by for example sending an SMS with an authorisation code. 
        Configure the webserver to use HTTPS or HSTS instead of HTTP which is less secure. Also is important to perform automatic vulnerability scans by using available the browser tools like Crashtext Security, Cyber Chief, and many others. Your security should be based on automation and integration. You can find multiple propositions in the browser. They protect your web from the attacks like Cross-site scripting, Command Injections, SQL scripting, Insecure server configuration, and Path Traversal. We also recommend penetration testing by performing a Mock Attack to check if sensitive data is safe and network security scanning. Your customers might provide your website with sensitive information and private data. Make sure to only ask for necessary data and secure it with visibility. Display for example only a few last digits of your user's credit card before you display it in the browser. Usually 4 last ones. Sanitize all user data before displaying it in the browser, also make sure that all of the user data is passed to an SQL query and that there is no possibility to change the nature of the query.
        Base your security on the Cybersecurity Framework. One of the most general, and popular is The NIST Framework but there are other custom choices too. The NIST CSF focus mostly on the most common risks and manages them.]</p>
